      "background": "ABL1 (also ABL) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase with ubiquitous cellular expression. ABL is located both in the cytoplasm and nucleus and can be activated by growth factor receptors, cellular kinases or DNA damage (PMID: 24421390, 1591775). In response to extrinsic ligand stimulation, ABL signaling regulates cellular proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and migration (PMID: 7651539, 7512450). ABL has additional cellular roles including regulation of actin polymerization, vascular development, transcription, and T cell maturation (PMID: 24421390). In chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphocytic leukemia (Ph+ ALL), translocations between the ABL and BCR genes result in the driver fusion protein BCR-ABL (PMID: 3460176, 2825022). The BCR-ABL fusion protein is a constitutively activated oncogenic tyrosine kinase that causes ligand-independent activation of signaling pathways in hematopoietic cells (PMID: 3460176, 2825022). The BCR-ABL fusion protein results in loss of auto-inhibition of ABL leading to activation of the kinase (PMID: 8246975). Alternative ABL1 translocations are also observed in myeloid disease (PMID: 9695962). Small molecule inhibitors of BCR-ABL, imatinib and dasatinib, have been developed and are FDA-approved for CML and Ph+ALL (PMID:11870241, 21931113). Mutations in the ABL kinase domain lead to resistance to these treatments and determine sensitivity to other second-generation inhibitors (PMID: 15256671).",

FDA approval was based on Phase II and Phase III studies of dasatinib in adult patients with imatinib-resistant Ph+ ALL in which major hematologic responses were seen in 38%-42% of patients (PMID: 17496201, 20131302). In a Phase II study of first-line dasatinib in adult patients with Ph+ ALL, the median overall survival and median disease-free survival were 30.8 and 21.5 months, respectively, with molecular response to dasatinib correlated to disease-free survival (PMID: 21931113), suggesting that dasatinib also has efficacy in the kinase-inhibitor-naive setting. Approval for pediatric patients with Ph+ ALL was based on the Phase II CA180-372 study of 78 pediatric patients with B-cell precursor Ph+ ALL of which there was an event-free survival (EFS) rate of 64.1% (95% CI = 52.4-74.7) (Abstract: Hunger et al.

In a Phase III study of nilotinib versus imatinib in 846 patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (Ph+ CML) in chronic phase, the rate of major molecular response was significantly higher in patients receiving nilotinib at either of two doses versus imatinib (43-44% vs. 22%, p < 0.001), as was the rate of complete cytogenetic response (78-80% vs. 65%, p < 0.001) (PMID: 20525993). Importantly, an analysis conducted at the three-year follow-up of patients from this study found significantly fewer ABL1 secondary mutations in patients treated with either dose of nilotinib versus those treated with imatinib, suggesting that nilotinib may prevent the majority of acquired ABL1 secondary resistance mutations that stem from BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibition and may prolong treatment responses to BCL-ABL inhibition (PMID: PMID: 23502220). More recent data from the Phase II ENESTop and ENESTfreedom studies have suggested that treatment with nilotinib can be stopped in certain patients who have received nilotinib for at least three years and have achieved specific predetermined criteria, a recommendation which is now included on the FDA label for nilotinib (PMID: 28218239).",

FDA approval was based on the results of a Phase III, two-arm, open-label, randomized, multicenter trial (NCT02130557) of bosutinib (n = 246 patients) versus imatinib (n = 241 patients) in 487 eligible adult patients with newly diagnosed CP Ph+ CML in which the major molecular and complete cytogenetic responses by month twelve were 47.2% (95% CI: 40.9, 53.4) and 77.2% (95% CI: 72.0, 82.5) in the bosutinib group, respectively, and 36.9% (95% CI: 30.8, 43.0) and 66.4% (95% CI: 60.4, 72.4) in the imatinib group, respectively (PMID: 29091516). In a separate single-arm, open-label, multicenter study (NCT00261846) designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bosutinib in 506 evaluable patients with Ph+ CML who were resistant or intolerant to prior therapy, 59.5% (95% CI: 53.3, 65.5) of the 262 evaluable patients with Ph+ CP CML who had prior treatment with imatinib achieved a major cytogenetic response at any time compared to 40.2% (95% CI: 31.0, 49.9) of the 112 patients with Ph+ CP CML who were treated with imatinib plus at least one additional TKI (PMID: 24345751, 26040495). Furthermore, 30.6% (95% CI: 20.2, 42.5) of the 72 patients with AP CML achieved complete hematologic response by week 48 compared to the 16.7% (95% CI: 8.3, 28.5) of 60 patients with BP CML (PMID: 24345751, 26040495). FDA approval of bosutinib for pediatric patients 1 year of age and older with CP Ph+ CML that is newly diagnosed or resistant or intolerant to prior therapy was based on the results of the BCHILD trial (NCT04258943). For newly diagnosed patients at 6 and 12 months the cumulative incidence of major cytogenetic response (MCyR) was 85% (95% CI: 49, 96) and 92.5% (95% CI: 39, 99), complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) was 77% (CI: 47, 91) and 88.3% (95% CI: 55, 98), and major molecular response (MMR) was 23% (95% CI: 7, 46) and 30% (95% CI: 10, 54), respectively (Abstract: Pennesi et al.

In a study of 186 patients with Ph+ CML, mutational analysis was performed upon treatment failure and revealed that T315I was detected in 27 patients: twenty after imatinib failure, and in 7/23 patients who developed new mutations after a median of ten months on a second TKI (four dasatinib, one nilotinib, one bosutinib) (PMID: 18403620). In a multicenter retrospective study of 27 Ph+ CML patients treated with imatinib who developed a T315I mutation, patients had poor prognostic features, including a lack of complete cytogenetic response (59%), overall survival rates of 42.5 months for chronic and 17.5 months for advanced phase patients, and 100% of patients progressed (PMID: 17768119).

Bosutinib demonstrated acceptable tolerability in a phase I/II trial (NCT00261846) of 24 patients with Ph+ ALL with resistance or intolerance to prior TKI therapy, and while responses were observed among some patients, analyses of these data were limited by the small number of ALL patients (PMID 26040495). Of note, two evaluable patients with ALL, one harboring a mutation in E255V, the other in F359C, did not achieve a response to bosutinib (PMID 26040495). In tritiated thymidine incorporation assays performed in Ba/F3 cells expressing one of eighteen different BCR-ABL mutations compared to BCR-ABL wild-type, 10/18 mutants were considered sensitive to bosutinib, including substrate binding region mutation F359V, and 8/18 mutations were considered moderately to highly resistant to bosutinib, including P-loop mutations E255V and E255K (PMID: 19075254).",

In tritiated thymidine incorporation assays performed in Ba/F3 cells expressing one of eighteen different BCR-ABL mutations compared to BCR-ABL wild-type, ten of eighteen mutants were considered sensitive to bosutinib, including substrate binding region mutation F359V, and eight of eighteen mutations were considered moderately to highly resistant to bosutinib, including P-loop mutations E255V and E255K (PMID: 19075254).",

In tritiated thymidine incorporation assays performed in Ba/F3 cells expressing one of eighteen different BCR-ABL mutations compared to BCR-ABL wildtype, eight of eighteen mutants were considered sensitive to dasatinib, including F359V, and ten of eighteen mutations were considered moderately to highly resistant to dasatinib, including E255V and E255K (PMID: 19075254). In cell proliferation assays, dasatinib was more effective than imatinib in inhibiting the proliferation of Ba/F3 cells expressing wild-type BCR-ABL or BCR-ABL mutants, including E255V, F359V, Y253H, and E255K, and biochemical assays showed that dasatinib inhibited ABL-catalyzed peptide substrate phosphorylation with approximately 325-fold higher potency than imatinib (PMID: 15930265). In a meta-analysis of three separate dasatinib trials in CP CML, of 402 patients with a BCR-ABL mutation, 362 patients (90%) had a complete hematologic response, 225 (56%) had a major cytogenetic response, and 175 (44%) had a complete cytogenetic response (PMID: 19779040).",

In tritiated thymidine incorporation assays performed in Ba/F3 cells expressing one of eighteen different BCR-ABL mutations compared to BCR-ABL wildtype, 5/18 mutants were considered sensitive to nilotinib, including V299L, and 13/18 mutations were considered moderately to highly resistant to nilotinib, including F317L (PMID: 19075254). In cell proliferation assays, nilotinib was more effective than imatinib at inhibiting the proliferation of Ba/F3 cells expressing wildtype BCR-ABL or BCR-ABL mutants, including F317L, and biochemical assays showed that nilotinib inhibited ABL-catalyzed peptide substrate phosphorylation with ∼20-fold higher potency than imatinib (PMID: 15930265). In a study of fifteen patients with TKI-resistant CML harboring the V299L mutation, 1/4 patients that received salvage therapy with nilotinib achieved a sustained major molecular response of 40+ months and another patient achieved a peripheral hematologic response for greater than six months (PMID 23086624).",

In a randomized, open-label, international, phase III study of dasatinib in 84 patients with Ph+ ALL resistant or intolerant to imatinib, the rates of confirmed major hematologic response in the once-(n = 40) and twice-daily (n = 44) dosing groups were 38% and 32%, respectively, and the rate of major cytogenetic response with once-daily dosing (70%) was higher than that with twice-daily dosing (52%) (PMID: 20131302). Compared with the twice-daily schedule, the once-daily schedule had shorter overall survival (median, 9.1 months versus 6.5 months, respectively) and longer progression-free survival (median, 3 months versus 4 months, respectively) (PMID: 20131302). In a study of nine Ph+ ALL patients who failed to respond to or relapsed during dasatinib therapy, BCR-ABL kinase sequences were analyzed before and during treatment and in all but one patient, resistance to dasatinib was found to be associated with mutations at residue 315 and/or at residue 317, including F317L (n =  3), F317I (n = 1), and T315A (n = 1) (PMID: 17339191).",

In a phase I dose-escalation study (NCT00109707) of nilotinib in 106 patients with Ph+ CML, multiple BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations were identified including G250E (n = 9), E255K (n = 4), E255V (n = 2), and F359V (n = 2), but these mutations did not affect response rates to nilotinib (PMID: 16775235). In a study of 54 patients with persistent CML who received nilotinib after imatinib failure as a second- or third-line treatment, the most frequent mutations found in patients with nilotinib failure were located in the P-loop, particularly Y253F/H, E255K, and G250E, as well as F359C/V (PMID: 17785585). In a retrospective analysis of treatment-emergent mutations and their impact on response in 563 patients with CP Ph+ CML who were treated with nilotinib as part of the ENESTnd phase III trial, multiple alterations were identified including G250E (n = 1), Y253H (n= 8), E255K (n = 4), E255V (n = 1), and F359V (n = 6), which resulted in suboptimal responses or treatment failure in most patients (PMID: 23502220). In a subanalysis of an open-label, phase II study of nilotinib in 281 evaluable patients with imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant CP Ph+ CML, patients with mutations that were less sensitive to nilotinib in vitro (IC50 > 150 nM; Y253H, E255V/K, F359V/C) had less favorable responses, where 13%, 43%, and 9% of patients with each of these mutations, respectively, achieved major cytogenetic response and none achieved complete cytogenetic response (PMID: 19652056). In a study looking at BCR-ABL mutation status in 50 imatinib-resistant patients with Ph+ leukemia before and during treatment with nilotinib as a second or third TKI, fourteen patients relapsed with evidence of newly acquired mutations including Y253H (n = 4/14), E255V (n = 3/14), E255K (n = 2/14), and F359V (n = 1/14), and three patients already harboring mutations (Y253H, n = 2/3; E255K + F317L, n = 1/3) did not achieve any response to nilotinib as second (Y253H) or third TKI (E255K + F317L) (PMID: 19589924).",

In a phase I dose-escalation study (NCT00109707) of nilotinib in thirteen patients with Ph+ ALL, one patient had a partial hematologic response and another had a complete molecular remission (PMID: 16775235). In a study of 54 patients with persistent CML who received nilotinib after imatinib failure as a second- or third-line treatment, the most frequent mutations found in patients with nilotinib failure were located in the P-loop, particularly Y253F/H, E255K, and G250E, as well as F359C/V (PMID: 17785585). In a retrospective analysis of treatment-emergent mutations and their impact on response in 563 patients with CP Ph+ CML who were treated with nilotinib as part of the ENESTnd phase III trial, multiple alterations were identified including G250E (n = 1), Y253H (n= 8), E255K (n = 4), E255V (n = 1), and F359V (n = 6), which resulted in suboptimal responses or treatment failure in most patients (PMID: 23502220). In a subanalysis of an open-label, phase II study of nilotinib in 281 evaluable patients with imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant CP Ph+ CML, patients with mutations that were less sensitive to nilotinib in vitro (IC50 > 150 nM; Y253H, E255V/K, F359V/C) had less favorable responses, where 13%, 43%, and 9% of patients with each of these mutations, respectively, achieved major cytogenetic response and none achieved complete cytogenetic response (PMID: 19652056). In a study looking at BCR-ABL mutation status in 50 imatinib-resistant patients with Ph+ leukemia before and during treatment with nilotinib as a second or third TKI, fourteen patients relapsed with evidence of newly acquired mutations including Y253H (n = 4/14), E255V (n = 3/14), E255K (n = 2/14), and F359V (n = 1/14), and three patients already harboring mutations (Y253H, n = 2/3; E255K + F317L, n = 1/3) did not achieve any response to nilotinib as second (Y253H) or third TKI (E255K + F317L) (PMID: 19589924).",

In a study of 297 evaluable Ph+ leukemia patients with evidence of hematologic or cytogenetic resistance to imatinib, amino acid substitutions at seven residues in the BCR-ABL kinase domain (KD) including E255K/V (n=21, 17%), Y253F/H (n=17, 13%), F359V/I (n=14, 11%), and G250E (n=13, 10%), accounted for the majority of resistance-associated mutations (PMID: 17189410). In a study (MAPTEST) of 92 Polish patients with Ph+ CML who were treated with imatinib for more than three months, twelve mutations were detected in 11/92 patients, including E255K (n = 1/11), E255V (n = 1/11), F359V (n = 2/11) and double-mutant F359V + Y253F (n = 1//11) (PMID: 20010464). In a study of 76 patients with Ph+ CML with suspected clinical resistance to imatinib, BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations were identified in 25/76 (33%) patients, including E255K (12%), G250E and Y253H (8% each), as well as F317L (4%) (PMID: 19925053). In a study analyzing BCR-ABL KD mutation status in 112 patients with persistent Ph+ CML who received a second-generation TKI after imatinib failure, several mutations were detected after imatinib and before second-line treatment, including G250E (n= 12), Y253H (n = 3), E255K (n = 3), F317L (n = 7), F359C (n = 3), and F359V (n = 1) (PMID: 17785585). Direct sequencing of 144 patients with Ph+ CML treated with imatinib for BCR-ABL KD mutations revealed multiple alterations that led to imatinib resistance, including G250E (n = 2), E255K (n = 5), E255V (n = 1), F317L (n = 2), and F359V (n = 2) (PMID: 12623848).",

In a study of 297 evaluable Ph+ leukemia patients with evidence of hematologic or cytogenetic resistance to imatinib, amino acid substitutions at seven residues in the ABL kinase domain (KD) including E255K/V (n=21, 17%), Y253F/H (n=17, 13%), F359V/I (n=14, 11%), and G250E (n=13, 10%), accounted for the majority of all resistance-associated mutations (PMID: 17189410). In a retrospective study of 26 evaluable newly diagnosed elderly patients with Ph+ ALL who enrolled in the German Multicenter Study Group for Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (GMALL) trial ADE10, BCR-ABL KD mutations were found in 21/26 patients (84%), including G250E (n = 5/21), Y253H (n = 2/21), E255K/V (n = 4/21), and F317L (n = 1/21) (PMID: 17405907). Upon sequencing the bone marrow of nine patients with Ph+ ALL who were treated with STI571 (imatinib) and developed resistance, 6/9 patients harbored the E255K mutation, which is located within the motif important for forming the pocket of the ATP-binding site in ABL (PMID: 11861307).",

ABL2 localizes to actin protrusions and mediates the formation and stabilization of actin filaments in coordination with cortactin (PMID: 30256707). β1 integrins signal via ABL2 pathways to control several cellular processes including neuronal stability, cell adhesion, cell migration, and invasion (PMID: 30256707, 25694433, 23365224). Phosphorylation of ABL2 by receptor tyrosine kinases and SRC family kinases results in ABL2 activation, autophosphorylation and subsequent activation of downstream signaling molecules, such as the transcription factor STAT3 (PMID: 21892207). ABL2 is localized in the cytoplasm and is overexpressed in a variety of solid tumors, resulting in enhanced cellular proliferation, invasion, and metabolic changes (PMID: 26645050). Recurrent ABL2 fusion proteins are found in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemias and gangliogliomas (PMID: 29507076, 29880043, 25098428, 10706884). ABL2 fusions result in increased ABL2-mediated signaling, suggesting that ABL2 functions as an oncogene (PMID: 25207766). ABL-targeted small molecule kinase inhibitors may be efficacious in cancers with ABL2 positive rearrangements (PMID: 29464092, 19451690, 25207766).",

      "background": "ATM is a member of the protein superfamily of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase related serine/threonine kinases (PIKKs). ATM functions as a tumor suppressor that initiates DNA damage checkpoint signaling after accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) or after accumulation of other forms of cellular stress (PMID: 23219553). Activated ATM can phosphorylate hundreds of substrates in order to initiate and amplify the DNA damage response (PMID: 17525332) resulting in DNA repair, cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. Germline, homozygous/compound heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in ATM have been identified in the autosomal recessive disorder ataxia telangiectasia (A-T), a disorder that presents with a variety of neurologic conditions, lung and skin disorders, and immunodeficiency (PMID: 21792198). Patients with A-T are also predisposed to a wide variety of cancers, particularly childhood lymphomas and leukemia as well as breast cancer (PMID: 21792198), whereas heterozygous carriers are at increased risk for adult-onset breast (PMID: 27112364, 31171119, 33471974), pancreatic (PMID: 22585167, 34529012), prostate (PMID: 33436325), gastroesophageal junction (PMID: 35078243), and other cancers. Somatic mutations in ATM have been identified in lymphoid malignancies and a selection of solid tumors (PMID: 12400598, 27413114). ATM-mutant cancers are increasingly sensitive to DNA damaging agents due to deficits in DNA repair pathways, and ATM loss may result in better response to checkpoint inhibition in some cancers (PMID: 27413114, 29489427).\n",

      "background": "BAP1 (BRCA-associated Protein-1) is a nuclear ubiquitin hydrolase that has been implicated in several cellular processes including cell proliferation, DNA repair, chromatin regulation of gene expression, and stem cell pluripotency (PMID: 19815555, 20805357, 18757409). By deubiquitinating host cell factor-1 (HCF-1), a chromatin-associated protein that helps regulate transcription, BAP1 regulates cell proliferation (PMID: 19815555). BAP1 has been shown to regulate gene expression by forming a ternary complex with HCF-1 and the YY1 transcription factor (PMID: 20805357) and to enhance cell death by increasing progression through the G1-S checkpoint (PMID: 18757409). BAP1 loss alters class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) expression, which may result in altered therapeutic response to HDAC inhibitors in BAP1-depleted cancer cells (PMID: 25970771). Germline mutations of the BAP1 tumor suppressor gene predispose to several tumors, most commonly including uveal melanoma, mesothelioma, cutaneous melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma, which suggests that BAP1 is a tumor suppressor (PMID: 21874000, 23277170, 23849051, 32690542). Somatic BAP1 mutations are also common in these tumor types, among others (PMID: 23867514, 21642991, 23277170).",

Heterozygous truncating variants in BAP1 are known to be pathogenic. This variant is absent from large population databases (1000 Genomes, ESP, and Broad ExAc). It has been reported in the literature to segregate with disease in four members of a family with melanoma or dysplastic nevi (PMID: 26774355). Immunohistochemistry of the tumors in this family showed loss of BAP1 protein expression.",

FDA-approval was based on Phase II and Phase III studies of dasatinib in adult patients with imatinib-resistant Ph+ ALL in which major hematologic responses were seen in 38%-42% of patients (PMID: 17496201, 20131302). In a Phase II study of first-line dasatinib in adult patients with Ph+ ALL, the median overall survival and median disease-free survival were 30.8 and 21.5 months, respectively, with molecular response to dasatinib correlated to disease-free survival (PMID: 21931113), suggesting that dasatinib also has efficacy in the kinase-inhibitor-naive setting. Approval for pediatric patients with Ph+ ALL was based on the Phase II CA180-372 study of 78 pediatric patients with B-cell precursor Ph+ ALL of which there was an event-free survival (EFS) rate of 64.1% (95% CI = 52.4-74.7) (Abstract: Hunger et al.

This fusion is commonly found in chronic myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphocytic leukemia. This fusion is well-studied and results in constitutive downstream JAK/STAT and PI3K signaling, resulting in growth-factor independence, inhibited apoptosis, altered cell motility and transformation (PMID: 11345193). Small molecule inhibitors of ABL1, including FDA-approved imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib, have had high levels of clinical activity in patients with the BCR-ABL1 fusion (PMID: 11870241)."

This fusion is well-studied and results in constitutive signaling through ABL1's tyrosine kinase domain, resulting in growth-factor independence, inhibited apoptosis and altered cell motility. The BCR-ABL1 fusion is able to induce neoplastic transformation of hematopoetic and fibroblast cells. The fusion can result in different isoforms, depending on the precise location of the fusion, with cancer-type specific prevalence. Its oncogenic potential is attributed to induction of multiple downstream pathways, including JAK/STAT and PI3K signaling (PMID: 18851712, 11345193)."

In a retrospective analysis of treatment-emergent mutations and their impact on response in 563 patients with CP Ph+ CML who were treated with nilotinib as part of the ENESTnd phase 3 trial, multiple alterations were identified including G250E (n = 1), Y253H (n= 8), E255K (n = 4), E255V (n = 1), and F359V (n = 6), which resulted in suboptimal responses or treatment failure in most patients (PMID: 23502220). In a subanalysis of an open-label, phase II study of nilotinib in 281 evaluable patients with imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant CP Ph+ CML, patients with mutations that were less sensitive to nilotinib in vitro (IC50 > 150 nM; Y253H, E255V/K, F359V/C) had less favorable responses, where 13%, 43%, and 9% of patients with each of these mutations, respectively, achieved major cytogenetic response and none achieved complete cytogenetic response (PMID: 19652056). In a study looking at BCR-ABL mutation status in 50 imatinib-resistant patients with Ph+ leukemia before and during treatment with nilotinib as a second or third TKI, fourteen patients relapsed with evidence of newly acquired mutations including Y253H (n = 4/14), E255V (n = 3/14), E255K (n = 2/14), and F359V (n = 1/14), and three patients already harboring mutations (Y253H, n = 2/3; E255K + F317L, n = 1/3) did not achieve any response to nilotinib as second (Y253H) or third TKI (E255K + F317L) (PMID: 19589924)."

This fusion has been found in T-ALL (PMID:15361874). Expression of this fusion in cell lines demonstrated that it is activating as measured by constitutive phosphorylation of the fusion and downstream target CRKL that can be inhibited upon treatment with imatinib (PMID:15361874).",

In a Phase III study of nilotinib versus imatinib in 846 patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (Ph+ CML) in chronic phase, the rate of major molecular response was significantly higher in patients receiving nilotinib at either of two doses versus imatinib (43-44% vs. 22%, p < 0.001), as was the rate of complete cytogenetic response (78-80% vs. 65%, p < 0.001) (PMID: 20525993). Importantly, an analysis conducted at the three-year follow-up of patients from this study found significantly fewer ABL1 secondary mutations in patients treated with either dose of nilotinib versus those treated with imatinib, suggesting that nilotinib may prevent the majority of acquired ABL1 secondary resistance mutations that stem from BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibition and may prolong treatment responses to BCL-ABL inhibition (PMID: PMID: 23502220). More recent data from the Phase II ENESTop and ENESTfreedom studies have suggested that treatment with nilotinib can be stopped in certain patients who have received nilotinib for at least three years and have achieved specific predetermined criteria, a recommendation which is now included on the FDA label for nilotinib (PMID: 28218239)."

The NCCN considers the ABL1 T315I mutation as \"contraindicated\" for the therapies imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib in patients with BCR-ABL1 positive (+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In a study of 186 patients with Ph+ CML, mutational analysis was performed upon treatment failure and revealed that T315I was detected in 27 patients: twenty after imatinib failure, and in 7/23 patients who developed new mutations after a median of ten months on a second TKI (four dasatinib, one nilotinib, one bosutinib) (PMID: 18403620). In a multicenter retrospective study of 27 Ph+ CML patients treated with imatinib who developed a T315I mutation, patients had poor prognostic features, including a lack of complete cytogenetic response (59%), overall survival rates of 42.5 months for chronic and 17.5 months for advanced phase patients, and 100% of patients progressed (PMID: 17768119). In a study of twelve Ph+ CML patients who failed to respond to or relapsed during dasatinib therapy, 9/12 patients harbored the T315I mutation, which has been shown to disrupt a hydrogen bond that is critical for dasatinib binding and to create steric hindrance that interferes with the inhibitor entering the ATP-binding site (PMID: 17339191).

In a subanalysis of an open-label, phase II study of nilotinib in 281 evaluable patients with imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant CP Ph+ CML, patients with mutations that were less sensitive to nilotinib in vitro (IC50 > 150 nM; Y253H, E255V/K, F359V/C) had less favorable responses, where 13%, 43%, and 9% of patients with each of these mutations, respectively, achieved major cytogenetic response and none achieved complete cytogenetic response (PMID: 19652056). In a study looking at BCR-ABL mutation status in 50 imatinib-resistant patients with Ph+ leukemia before and during treatment with nilotinib as a second or third TKI, fourteen patients relapsed with evidence of newly acquired mutations including Y253H (n = 4/14), E255V (n = 3/14), E255K (n = 2/14), and F359V (n = 1/14), and three patients already harboring mutations (Y253H, n = 2/3; E255K + F317L, n = 1/3) did not achieve any response to nilotinib as second (Y253H) or third TKI (E255K + F317L) (PMID: 19589924)."

FDA approval was based on the results of a Phase III, two-arm, open-label, randomized, multicenter trial (NCT02130557) of bosutinib (n = 246 patients) versus imatinib (n = 241 patients) in 487 eligible adult patients with newly diagnosed CP Ph+ CML in which the major molecular and complete cytogenetic responses by month twelve were 47.2% (95% CI: 40.9, 53.4) and 77.2% (95% CI: 72.0, 82.5) in the bosutinib group, respectively, and 36.9% (95% CI: 30.8, 43.0) and 66.4% (95% CI: 60.4, 72.4) in the imatinib group, respectively (PMID: 29091516). In a separate single-arm, open-label, multicenter study (NCT00261846) designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bosutinib in 506 evaluable patients with Ph+ CML who were resistant or intolerant to prior therapy, 59.5% (95% CI: 53.3, 65.5) of the 262 evaluable patients with Ph+ CP CML who had prior treatment with imatinib achieved a major cytogenetic response at any time compared to 40.2% (95% CI: 31.0, 49.9) of the 112 patients with Ph+ CP CML who were treated with imatinib plus at least one additional TKI (PMID: 24345751, 26040495).

ABL2 localizes to actin protrusions and mediates the formation and stabilization of actin filaments in coordination with cortactin (PMID: 30256707). β1 integrins signal via ABL2 pathways to control several cellular processes including neuronal stability, cell adhesion, cell migration, and invasion (PMID: 30256707, 25694433, 23365224). Phosphorylation of ABL2 by receptor tyrosine kinases and SRC family kinases results in ABL2 activation, autophosphorylation and subsequent activation of downstream signaling molecules, such as the transcription factor STAT3 (PMID: 21892207). ABL2 is localized in the cytoplasm and is overexpressed in a variety of solid tumors, resulting in enhanced cellular proliferation, invasion, and metabolic changes (PMID: 26645050). Recurrent ABL2 fusion proteins are found in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemias and gangliogliomas (PMID: 29507076, 29880043, 25098428, 10706884). ABL2 fusions result in increased ABL2-mediated signaling, suggesting that ABL2 functions as an oncogene (PMID: 25207766). ABL-targeted small molecule kinase inhibitors may be efficacious in cancers with ABL2 positive rearrangements (PMID: 29464092, 19451690, 25207766).",

          "article": "Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is an incurable pediatric brain tumor, with approximately 25% of DIPGs harboring activating ACVR1 mutations that commonly co-associate with H3.1K27M mutations. Here we show that in vitro expression of ACVR1 R206H with and without H3.1K27M upregulates mesenchymal markers and activates Stat3 signaling. In vivo expression of ACVR1 R206H or G328V with H3.1K27M and p53 deletion induces glioma-like lesions but is not sufficient for full gliomagenesis. However, in combination with PDGFA signaling, ACVR1 R206H and H3.1K27M significantly decrease survival and increase tumor incidence. Treatment of ACVR1 R206H mutant DIPGs with exogenous Noggin or the ACVR1 inhibitor LDN212854 significantly prolongs survival, with human ACVR1 mutant DIPG cell lines also being sensitive to LDN212854 treatment. Together, our results demonstrate that ACVR1 R206H and H3.1K27M promote tumor initiation, accelerate gliomagenesis, promote a mesenchymal profile partly due to Stat3 activation, and identify LDN212854 as a promising compound to treat DIPG.",
